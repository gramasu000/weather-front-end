/* This module has the API key for OpenWeatherMap
 * To get an API key, get an account on openweathermap.org
 * for a free or paid subscription, go to API keys and create a key
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Make sure changes to this file do NOT get pushed to github
 * if you don't want your api key to be seen by the world in github.com
 *
 * To do that, use the following command
 *
 *    git --update-index --assume-unchanged src/appid.js
 *
 * This will make git blind to whatever changes you make to this file
 * For some reason if you want to undo this, do
 * git --update-index --no-assume-unchanged src/appid.js
